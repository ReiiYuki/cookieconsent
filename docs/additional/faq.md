### Does this plugin store consent records?

CookieConsent is a client-side script only and therefore cannot store any kind of server-side data.

You will have to either implement your own API and database or completely switch to a more mainstream solution.

### How can I block iframes?

You can block iframes using [iframemanager](https://github.com/orestbida/iframemanager), a small plugin designed specifically for this task.
