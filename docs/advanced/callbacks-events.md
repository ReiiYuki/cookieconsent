# Callbacks and Events
There are a few callbacks/events at your disposal to handle different kinds of situations. Each callback has a corresponding custom event, named after the callback function itself.

Available callbacks/events:

- `onFirstConsent`
- `onConsent`
- `onChange`

## onFirstConsent
This event is triggered only the very first time that the user expresses their choice of consent (accept/reject).

- **Type**
    ```javascript
    function(): void
    ```

- **Example** <br>

    ```javascript
    cc.run({
        onFirstConsent: function(){
            // do something
        }
    });
    ```

    using event listener:
    ```javascript
    window.addEventListener('onFirstConsent', function(){
        // do something
    });
    ```

## onConsent
This event is triggered the very first time the user expresses expresses their choice of consent — just like `onFirstConsent` — but also **on every subsequent page load**.

- **Type**
    ```javascript
    function(): void
    ```

- **Example** <br>

    ```javascript
    cc.run({
        onConsent: function(){
            // do something
        }
    });
    ```

    using event listener:
    ```javascript
    window.addEventListener('onConsent', function(){
        // do something
    });
    ```

## onChange
This event is triggered when the user modifies their preferences and only if consent has already been provided.

- **Type**
    ```javascript
    function(): void
    ```

- **Example** <br>

    ```javascript
    cc.run({
        onChange: function(){
            // do something
        }
    });
    ```

    using event listener:
    ```javascript
    window.addEventListener('onChange', function(){
        // do something
    });
    ```

If you're using custom events, make sure to subscribe to the specific event prior to the plugin's execution, to avoid potential inconsistent behaviors.
